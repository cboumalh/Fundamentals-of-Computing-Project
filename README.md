# Fundamentals-of-Computing-Project

In this project, our professor gave us the opportunity to work on anything we would like as long as it uses the animations library (gfx) he gave us.
The main requirement was that whatever we worked on had to have some complexity to it and must be interactive.
I worked on building a space invaders game in C. Enemies are attacking you and you must shoot them with the cannon. There is a score to see how many invaders have been
shot down. As time goes by, more and more invaders attack at higher speeds. It becomes harder!
This project was my first attempt at building any game, and it was a bit challenging in C, but I got it to work. Overall, I learned a lot during this project.
I had to use a lot of trig and algebra and it also required some logic.

To play the game:
1) run the 'make' command
2) make sure you have the Xlaunch app on the computer to set the display
3) run './project' and the screen should pop up.
4) press on the screen to shoot!
